## Project Description

This project is fork of uniswapV2 in with addition fee of 4% is taken from each trade, with 2% coming from the incoming token and 2% coming from the outgoing token. For example, if a user swaps $100 worth of BUSD for USDC, they will receive 96 dollars worth of USDC, and the exchange's reward wallet will receive $2 worth of BUSD and $2 worth of USDC.

## For achiving this task I have done the following:

1. UniswapV2Router02.sol
    * Modified all the swap functions to add a fee of 2% for outgoing token. (98% of the outgoing token will be sent to the recipient and 2% will be sent to the treasury wallet.)
    * Fee will be sent to the treasury wallet.
2. UniswapV2Pair.sol
    * Modified the _swap function to add a fee of 2% for incoming token.
    * Fee will be sent to the treasury wallet.

3. UniswapV2Factory.sol
    * Added a treasury wallet where the fees are sent to.
    * Added a function to set the treasury wallet.
    * Added a function to update treasury wallet.

4. UniswapV2Library.sol
    *  Modified the getAmountsOut function to remove liquidity fee from all transactions.
    * Modified the getAmountsIn function to remove liquidity fee from all transactions.
    * Modified the getAmountIn and getAmountOut functions to remove liquidity fee from all transactions.

## Test

For a unit testing smart contract using the command line.

```
$ npx hardhat test
```

Expecting `router-test.js` result.
