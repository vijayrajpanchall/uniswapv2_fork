# DEx(UniswapV2) Task

## About
On this decentralized exchange, a fee of 4% is taken from each trade, with 2% coming from the incoming token and 2% coming from the outgoing token. For example, if a user swaps $100 worth of BUSD for USDC, they will receive 96 dollars worth of USDC, and the exchange's reward wallet will receive $2 worth of BUSD and $2 worth of USDC.
